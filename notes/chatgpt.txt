I am a data encoder in our company, but i do basic trouble shooting to help my non tech workmates to do their tasks better, like excel, word , canva etc. should i put it in my resume, how should i put it?
ChatGPT said:
Yes! You should definitely include this in your resume because it shows that you have technical skills and problem-solving abilities, even if it's not your official job title. Many companies value employees who take initiative to help others with tech-related tasks.

📌 How to Include It in Your Resume?
Option 1: Add It Under Your Job Experience (Best for Highlighting Extra IT Skills)
📍 Job Title: Data Encoder (with IT Support Responsibilities)
📍 Company: [Your Company Name]
📍 Dates of Employment: [Start Date] – Present

Responsibilities:

Performed basic troubleshooting for colleagues on Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint).
Assisted team members in using Canva for presentations and marketing materials.
Provided technical support for minor software and hardware issues.
Helped optimize Excel spreadsheets for data organization and automation.
Option 2: Add It as a Separate "Technical Support Experience" Section
If you want to emphasize your IT-related tasks separately, you can add a new section:

🔹 Technical Support Experience (Informal IT Assistance)

Provided basic troubleshooting for non-tech colleagues.
Assisted with Excel formulas, formatting, and data automation.
Helped in Canva design tasks for company presentations.
Supported team members with Microsoft Office and other productivity tools.
Option 3: Highlight It Under "Skills"
If you don’t want to create a new section, you can just include it under Skills:

✅ Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint)
✅ Canva Design & Editing
✅ Basic Troubleshooting & IT Support
✅ Data Organization & Process Automation

💡 Why Is This Important?
Even though your title is Data Encoder, these additional IT-related tasks make your resume stand out—especially if you want to transition into an IT career. It shows initiative, tech proficiency, and a problem-solving mindset!

You said:
I don't help for marketing materials, it is like when they ask me about the design i could give them a hint for a more enticing or good look of the design.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! Since you provide guidance on design improvements rather than actively creating marketing materials, I’ll adjust the wording accordingly.

📌 How to Include It in Your Resume?
🔹 Option 1: Under Your Job Experience (Best for Highlighting Extra IT Support Skills)

Responsibilities:

Assisted colleagues with basic troubleshooting on Microsoft Office (Excel, Word).
Guided team members on improving their document and presentation designs in Canva.
Provided technical support for minor software and hardware issues.

🔹 Option 2: List It Under “Technical Support Experience”
If you want to highlight your tech-related tasks separately, you can add a section like this:

Technical Support & IT Assistance

Assisted colleagues with basic troubleshooting for Excel, Word, and other office tools.
Provided suggestions to improve visual presentation and document layouts in Canva.
Helped optimize spreadsheets for better data management and automation.
Supported team members with general software-related queries.
🔹 Option 3: Include It Under “Skills”
If you prefer a simple approach, you can just include it under your Skills section:

✅ Canva (Guidance on Layout & Design Enhancements)
✅ Data Organization & Spreadsheet Optimization

💡 Why Is This Useful?

my coworker gave me hint for designing like marketing color wheel, is it good?
ChatGPT said:
Yes! Using the marketing color wheel as a reference for design is a great idea. It helps ensure that colors are visually appealing, psychologically effective, and aligned with branding principles.

📌 Why Is It Useful?
✅ Enhances Readability & Aesthetic Appeal – Choosing the right color contrasts makes text and visuals stand out.
✅ Elicits Emotional Responses – Different colors evoke different feelings (e.g., blue = trust, red = urgency).
✅ Improves Branding Consistency – Helps maintain a professional and cohesive look.

🎨 How Can You Apply It?
If you often give design suggestions, you can use the marketing color wheel to:

Recommend better color contrasts for readability.
Suggest complementary colors for a visually balanced design.
Guide colleagues in choosing brand-consistent colors.
Would you like me to summarize this in a way you can add to your resume or use in your work? 😊
